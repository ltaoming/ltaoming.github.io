## **Research and Implementation of Activity Recognition Algorithm**

### ðŸ“œ Project Description

###### â€£ Developed an **Android smartwatch** sensor data collection application for **TicWatch Pro 3**. The application efficiently collects, preprocesses, and stores data from various sensors like the gyroscope at different frequencies and active labels.

###### â€£ Implemented the **Kalman Filter** to eliminate data noise, and stored the final data in *.csv* format using the **FTP Protocol**.

###### â€£ Utilized **NavExplorer** for seamless storage confirmation and connection between the smartwatch and computer.

###### â€£ Incorporated residual connections and bidirectional units to **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) to ensure effective information transmission.

###### â€£ The constructed network achieved **5% higher** compared to the simple LSTM network on activity recognition of the smartwatch dataset generated by the mobile application.
